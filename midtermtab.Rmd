## Instruction

The midterm has two components: the Rmarkdown notebook (html) and the presentation.  We will do the presentation in class. Post both the notebook and the presentation on your Github page. 

**The notebook:** The notebook should be created using `rmarkdown` or Quarto (like other assignments). The notebook should have a title. 


**The Presentation:** Present your results in 5-10 minutes. To make the presentation using Rmarkdown, do the follows: 

    - In Rstudio -> File -> New File -> R markdown
    
    - In the left panel, click to Presentation -> Click OK
    
    - Now you have an Rmarkdown that can be knitted to be a html presentation 
    
- You can also use the Rmd templates of the class slides. 

- You can also use Quarto to create the presentation: *In Rstudio -> File -> New File -> Quarto Presentation...*
    
- You do not need to rerun all the codes for the presentation. For example, to show the model comparison, you just need to show the image of the model comparison instead of running all the models again.
    
- To inset an image in a slide, use  `![](image.png)`

- To scale images, you can use `![](image.png){width="60%"}` or follow these below instructions.

    - http://zevross.com/blog/2017/06/19/tips-and-tricks-for-working-with-images-and-figures-in-r-markdown-documents/

- To turn off message and warning of a code cell, use:  `{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}` for the cell. 

**What to present**:

  - Present Part 2 - Visualization
  
  - Present Question Question 4, 5 and 6 in Part 3.  
  
  - Present any errors/challenges you run into and how you fix/overcome them. 

**Data:**  

The data for the mid-term project is the Rhode Island Department of Health Hospital Discharge Data.  Each row of the data presents a patient. 

Link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=15QNBf6YYKocK2nNIfpKDer58kQnCPNZJ 

**Notice**

- Since this is a large dataset, you could try to run the codes on the smaller dataset, which is a portion of the original dataset before running the codes on the original data.  To create a random subset of the data you could use

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# find the number of rows of the data
n = nrow(df)

# subset 1000 rows of the data
df1 = df[sample(1:n, 1000), ]
```

## I. Data Wranggling

1. Download the data file `hdd0318cy.sas7bdat`.  

2. Use `read_sas` in library `haven` to read the data. 
```{r}
library(haven)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
#df = read_sas('hdd0318cy.sas7bdat')
df = read_csv('MaseraEmilyMidterm.csv')
```
    
3. Filter the data to have only patients of the year 2018 (`yod=18`)
```{r}
df1 = df %>% filter(yod == 18)

```
    
4. Select to work with only following variables: 

                      "yod", "payfix","pay_ub92","age",  
                      "sex","raceethn","provider","moa", 
                      "yoa","mod","admtype", "asource" , 
                      "preopday" ,"los", "service" , "icu","ccu",    
                      "dispub92", "payer"  ,"drg","trandb", 
                      "randbg","randbs","orr", "anes","seq",   
                      "lab","dtest", "ther","blood","phar", 
                      "other","patcon","bwght","total","tot" ,  
                      "ecodub92","b_wt","pt_state","diag_adm","ancilar" ,
                      "campus","er_fee","er_chrg","er_mode","obs_chrg",
                   "obs_hour","psycchrg","nicu_day"
```{r}
df = df1 %>% select("yod", "payfix","pay_ub92","age",  
                      "sex","raceethn","provider","moa", 
                      "yoa","mod","admtype", "asource" , 
                      "preopday" ,"los", "service" , "icu","ccu",    
                      "dispub92", "payer"  ,"drg","trandb", 
                      "randbg","randbs","orr", "anes","seq",   
                      "lab","dtest", "ther","blood","phar", 
                      "other","patcon","bwght","total","tot" ,  
                      "ecodub92","b_wt","pt_state","diag_adm","ancilar" ,
                      "campus","er_fee","er_chrg","er_mode","obs_chrg",
                      "obs_hour","psycchrg","nicu_day")
```

 

*Notice*:  You may want to save the current data to your computer for easy access later.  To save the data file use `write_csv(df, 'midterm.csv')`, for example.  Also notice that, empty values in the data before writing to csv may turn to NAs later when you re-read the file. 
```{r}
write_csv(df1, 'MaseraEmilyMidterm.csv' )

```

5. What are variables that have missing values?
```{r}
colSums(is.na(df1))
```
 
6. Remove all variables with missing values. 
```{r}
df = df %>% select(-payfix, -raceethn, -admtype, -asource, -preopday, -bwght, -ecodub92, -pt_state, -diag_adm, -er_mode, -obs_hour, -nicu_day)
```
 
7. Refer to the data description in the file `HDD2015-18cy6-20-19.docx`, which variable recording the month of admission?, which variable recording the month of discharge?
##The variable for month of admission is moa and the variable for month of discharge is mod##

8. Which month admitted the most number of patients? Which month admitted the most number of male patients?
```{r}
df %>% count(moa) %>% arrange(-n)
##October admitted the most number of patients##
df %>% filter(sex=='1') %>% count(moa) %>% arrange(-n)
##October also admitted the most male patients##
```

9. Which month has the most number of teenage female patients?
```{r}
df %>% filter(sex=='2', age>='13'& age<='19') %>%
  count(moa) %>% arrange(-n)
## March has the most number of teenage female patients##
```

10. Which provider has the most number of female patients in October? 
```{r}
df %>% filter(sex=='2', moa=='10') %>% count(provider) %>% arrange(-n)
##provider 7205 has the most number of female patietns in October
```

11. Are female patients older than male patients, on average? 
```{r}
df %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarise(average_age = mean(age)) %>% arrange(-average_age)
##Male patients are older on average##
```

12. Calculate the average age of patients by months. Which month has the oldest patients on average age?
```{r}
df %>% group_by(moa) %>% summarise(average_age = mean(age)) %>% arrange(-average_age)
##January has the oldest average age##
```

13. What is the name of the provider that has the highest total charge?
```{r}
df %>% group_by(provider) %>% summarise(average_tot = mean(tot)) %>% arrange(-average_tot)
##Provider 7215 has the highest total charge##
```

14. What is the name of the provider that has the least total charge for teenage male on average?
```{r}
df %>% group_by(provider) %>% filter(sex=='1', age>='13'& age<='19') %>% summarise(average_tot = mean(tot)) %>% arrange(average_tot)
##provider 7206 has the least total charge for teenage male on average##
```

15. Create a season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter) variable. Calculate the length of stays by season.  Which season has the longest length of stays on average?
```{r}
df$season <- case_when(df$moa >=3 & df$moa < 6 ~ 'Spring', df$moa >= 6 & df$moa < 9 ~'Summer', df$moa >=9 & df$moa <12 ~ 'Fall', TRUE ~ 'Winter')
df %>% group_by(season) %>% summarise(average_los = mean(los)) %>% arrange(-average_los)
##Summer has the longest length of stay on average##
```

16. On average, how much a 20 year-old male get charged for staying 1 day in the Fall season?
```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(sex=='1', age=='20', season=='Fall', los=='1') %>% 
  summarise(average_tot = mean(tot)) %>% 
  arrange(average_tot)
##On average, a 20 year old male gets charged $16,511 for staying 1 day in the fall season##
```

17. Write a paragraph to summarize the section and give your comments on the results. You could do some other calculations to support your points. 

October tells to be the month that most people are admitted. The admitted people tend to be older and are females. However, older people tend to be admitted more in January. Summer has the longest length of stay and Bradley (provider 7215) has the highest charge of all providers.I used functions such as 'filter', 'group_by', 'summarise' and 'arrange' to come to all of these conclusions. I feel as though this dataset has so many other possible opportunties to use other functions within R to calculate statistics.

## II. Data Visualization

Continue with the data from part I. 

1. Provides at least 10 meaningful plots. Comments on the plots. All plots should have title, caption, appropriate labels on x and y-axis
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
df$sex = case_when(df$sex == 1 ~ 'Male',
                   df$sex == 2 ~ 'Female',
                   TRUE ~ 'Unknown')

df %>% ggplot() + geom_point(mapping=aes(x=age, y=los)) + facet_wrap(~sex) +
  labs(x='Age', 
       y = 'Length of Stay', 
       title = 'Length of Stay by Age and Sex', 
       caption = 'Younger people of both genders seem to generally have longer stays than older people. The plots are similar between the two genders.')

df %>% ggplot()+
  geom_density(mapping = aes(x = age)) +
  labs(x="Age", y="Density", title = "Age Distribution", caption='It is more common that people in their 60s are admitted than any other age range.')

df %>% ggplot()+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = campus))+
  labs(x="Campus", y="Count", title = "Campus of Patients Distribution", caption='Campus 0 is the most common campus of the patient to be on.') 

df %>% ggplot()+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = sex))+
  labs(x="Sex", y="Count", title = "Sex Distribution", caption="Females are most commonly admitted") 

df %>% ggplot()+geom_point(aes(x=age, y=los))+
  labs(x="Age", y="Length of Stay", title = "Length of Stay by Age", caption="The average length of stay is typically longer for people around the age of 30") 

df %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = age, y = sex))+
  labs(x='Age',
       y='Sex',
       title='Age Distributions Based on Sex',
       caption='A box plot displaying summary statistics for patient age for each sex.')

df %>% ggplot() + geom_point(mapping=aes(x=age, y=tot)) + facet_wrap(~sex) +
  labs(x='Age', 
       y = 'Total Charge', 
       title = 'Total Charge by Age', 
       caption = 'Most higher charges occur in very young patients.')

df %>% group_by(sex,age) %>% 
  summarise(mean_charge = mean(tot)) %>% ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x=age, y=mean_charge, fill=sex), position = 'dodge') +
  labs(x='Age', 
       y='Average Total Charge',
       fill = 'Sex', 
       title = 'Average Total Charge by Age and Sex', 
       caption = 'There is a peak in average change at the age of 15, especially for males. The average total charge generally increases until age 70 and then decreases after. And males generally have the highest average total charges for most ages.')

df %>% ggplot()+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = provider))+
  labs(x="Provider", y="Count", title = "Provider Distribution", caption="The most commonly used provider is Rhode Island Hospital") 

df %>% ggplot() + geom_bar(mapping=aes(x=sex, fill=season), position = 'dodge') +
  labs(x='Season', 
       y='Count',
       fill = 'Season', 
       title = 'Count By Season', 
       caption = 'All seasons admit around the same amount of patients, but spring
       admits the most.')
```

2. Make an animation plot. 
```{r}
library(gganimate)
df %>% ggplot()+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = sex)) + transition_states(age) +
  labs(x="Sex", y="Count", title = "Sex Distribution by Age", caption="This show the gender most commonly admitted for each age") 
```

3. Write a paragraph to summarize the section and give your comments on the results. 

From these 11 graphs, I used geom_bar, ggplot, geom_col, and other coding techniques we learned in class to summarize some of the data. A few things I took away from these graphs were that younger people of both male and female genders tend to stay longer in the hospital than older people, it is most common for people in their 60s to be admitted than any other age range, females are more commonly admitted and most higher charges occur in very young patients or middle aged maled. There is endless amounts of graphs possible to make for this dataset but these were some of my key takeaways on the ones that I coded

## III. Predictive Models

Continue with the data from part I. Make sure you do not have any missing values in the data. Use the follows as the target and input variables: 

*Target Variable*: Create the target variable taking value of 

  - `low` if the total charge of a patient (`tot`) is smaller than the median of the total charge, and

  - `high` otherwise. 
```{r}
df$target = case_when(df$tot < median(df$tot) ~ 'low',
                   TRUE ~ 'high')
```

*Input Variables*:

  - "age","sex","raceethn","provider","moa","mod","admtype","campus", 'los'
  
-------

1. Use `filter` function to filter out rows where `raceethn==''` or `admtype==''`. Make sure all the categorical variables are factor, numeric variables are numeric. Set Training : Testing Split = 10 : 90 
```{r}
library(caret)
df <- df %>% filter('raceethn'!='', 'admtype'!='')
df$tot2 <- ifelse(df$tot<median(df$tot),'low', 'high')
df <- df %>% 
  mutate(target = as.factor(tot2),
         sex = as.factor(sex),
         raceehtn = as.factor('raceethn'),
         campus = as.factor(campus),
         moa = as.factor(moa),
         mod = as.factor(mod),
         admtype=as.factor('admtype'))
df <- df %>% 
  mutate(age = as.numeric(age),
         los = as.numeric(los))
df <- df %>% select('target','age','sex','provider','moa','mod','campus','los')
set.seed(2020)
splitIndex <- createDataPartition(df$target, p = .10, list=FALSE)
df_train <- df[ splitIndex,]
df_test <- df[-splitIndex,]
```

2. Train a decision tree using `rpart`.  Plot the decision tree. Plot the variable importance ranked by the tree. 
```{r}
library(rpart)
library(rattle)
tree_model <- rpart(target ~ ., data = df_train,
                 control = rpart.control(maxdepth = 3))
library(rattle)
fancyRpartPlot(tree_model)
tree_model$variable.importance
barplot(tree_model$variable.importance)
pred <- predict(tree_model, df_test, type = "class")
cm <- confusionMatrix(data = pred, reference = df_test$target)
cm$overall[1]
```

3. Using caret for this question. Set `Training Control` to be: Use Cross-Validation of 5 folds across all models.  Train & tune at least 2 different models (i.e. two different values for `method=` in the train function of caret).  Plot the hyper-parameter tuning plots for each model. 
```{r}
library(caret)


tuneGrid = expand.grid(maxdepth = 2:4)
trControl = trainControl(method = "cv",
                         number = 3)
tree_approach2 <- train(target~., data=df_train, 
                  method = "rpart2", trControl                        
                  =trControl, tuneGrid = tuneGrid)
plot(tree_approach2)
trControl1 = trainControl(method = "cv",
                         number = 3)
tuneGrid1 = expand.grid(mtry = 2:4,
          splitrule = c('gini', 'extratrees'),
           min.node.size = c(2:5))
forest_ranger <- train(target~., data=df_train, 
                    method = "ranger", 
                    trControl = trControl1,
                    tuneGrid = tuneGrid1)
plot(forest_ranger)
```

4. Plot the comparison of the models in 3. 
```{r}
results <- resamples(list('Decision Tree' = tree_approach2,'Random Forest' = forest_ranger))

bwplot(results)
```

5. What is your final selection for the model? Test the accuracy of your final model on the test data. 
```{r}
##Final selection for the model is the tree model##
pred1 <- predict(tree_approach2, df_test)
cm1 <- confusionMatrix(data = pred1, reference = df_test$target)
cm1$overall[1]
```

6. Create another `target` variable (binary), decide the input variables and redo 1 to 5. 
```{r}
df$target = case_when(df$los < mean(df$los) ~ 'low',
                   TRUE ~ 'high')

df$moa = as.numeric(df$moa)

df$season = case_when(df$moa < 3 ~ 'Winter',
                      df$moa < 6 ~ 'Spring',
                      df$moa < 9 ~ 'Summer',
                      df$moa < 12 ~ 'Fall',
                      TRUE ~ 'Winter')

df = df %>% select("age","sex","provider","moa","mod", "campus","season","target")

df = df %>% filter('raceethn'>=1, 'admtype'>=1)
df$target = as.factor(df$target)
df$season = as.factor(df$season)

splitIndex <- createDataPartition(df$target, p = .10, 
                                  list = FALSE)
df_train <- df[ splitIndex,]
df_test <- df[-splitIndex,]
tree_model <- rpart(target ~ ., data = df_train,
                 control = rpart.control(maxdepth = 3))

fancyRpartPlot(tree_model)
barplot(tree_model$variable.importance)
trControl = trainControl(method = "cv",
                         number = 5)
tuneGrid = expand.grid(mtry = 2:3,
                       splitrule = c('gini', 'extratrees'),
                       min.node.size = c(1:5))

forest_ranger <- train(target~., data=df_train,
                       method = "ranger",
                       trControl = trControl,
                       tuneGrid = tuneGrid)

plot(forest_ranger)
tuneGrid_rf = expand.grid(mtry = c(2:5))
rf <- train(target~., data=df_train, 
                    method = "rf", 
                    trControl = trControl,
                    tuneGrid = tuneGrid_rf)
plot(rf)
results <- resamples(list('Ranger' = forest_ranger,
                          'Random Forest'= rf))
bwplot(results)
pred <- predict(forest_ranger, df_test)
cm <- confusionMatrix(data = pred, reference = df_test$target, positive = "high")
cm$overall[1]
```

7. Write a paragraph to summarize the section and give your comments on the results. 

#7cFrom this section on predictive models, I learned a lot. I feel as though there were so many different binary variables that I could have created and gone through problems 1-5 with to get to a conclusion. For the first set of models predicting whether the total charge for a patient was above or below the median total charge resulted in very strong models. The ranger had approximately 76% accuracy with the test data. For the second model, the ranger was with approximately 70% accuracy. I used libraries such as rattle, rpart and caret to made conclusions.#
