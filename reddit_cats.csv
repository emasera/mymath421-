2023-11-13,1699888363,Clingy Cat,"I recently got 2 new kittens, both of them are a few months old. One of them is so clingy and no matter how many times I push her off she comes back. It was cute the first week and ive been letting her and petting her when she does come but its really starting to piss me off.

I know it sounds cruel but its really been messing with my life, like when Im trying to work she jumps on my lap, claws beared, and starts climbing me. I still have multiple cuts there. And its like she has no brain i swear =- when i push her off she comes right back, even if i do so 10+ times in a row. 

Even when Im relaxing or watching TV, she comes up to my face and starts rubbing off on me so hard I dont know whats up with her, she wont even let me look away, and I cant even cook or eat without her jumping and trying to steal the food, when i push her she comes back again and i have to lock her in another room. Her sibling doesnt do any of those things. Do you have any advice on how to help with this? Or do i have to suck it up?",cats,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/17ucqv0/clingy_cat/

2023-11-12,1699798269,Cats opening air vents,"We have two kittens Howie (9 months) and Kirk (5 months).

When we only had Howie and he was staying in a bedroom, he has pulled out the air vent cover but luckily did not go inside. We were super paranoid and we put his cat scratcher half on it so he couldnt lift it. That was the end of that issue and we were able to take the cat scratcher off the vent because Howie had no interest anymore. 

Kirk has been with us for a bit over 3 months and is fully comfy. Hes an orange cat and he loves getting into things, the curtains, the blinds, the tv stand, and most recently - the air vent covers. 
We put the heat on for the first time this season and he laid on the vent which was super cute and he enjoyed the warm feeling, but this morning he has pulled the cover out. I put a heavy box of litter on the corner so that he couldnt lift it but hes been going at it anyways. Writing this post Ive had to stop to remove him from the area 3 times, and then turn the heat off. 
Generally we would just put something on it like Ive just done with the one hes fixated on, but I fear he would try the other vents after awhile. We have about 6 just on the main floor alone and one in their cat bedroom. 

Ive attached photos of the vent cover, they are made of plastic and are very light. I was curious if anyone has any tips or tricks to help, or if anyone thinks it would be a good idea to buy metal covers that are a bit heavier? 

Also what would we do if he DID open it and climbed inside where we couldnt get him?

This was all a LIE. Little miss isn't exactly antisocial, but she's not a cuddler and won't let me touch her (she will play and has slowly started creeping closer to me).  She is LIVING IT UP though.

We went today to see the kitten we were told about, and so far she seems absolutely adorable. As she's still young (Under a month old) we haven't taken her yet and will be waiting until she's older, but she's ours. I was pretty focused on her and making sure she stayed safe so I don't have a lot of photos but I caught some pretty cute ones, especially of her with her grandma (The mother of the cat that had the litter)

We're looking for a name that would work well alongside Ice (Our older Siamese cat) and we came up with some names but I dunno about them, not sure. We still have a few weeks to decide on a name (The ones we came up with are Kassie/Cassie, Mist/Misty, and Sky because idk it's a cute name)

2023-11-10,1699578400,Christmas and cats - raw post out of my love for these emotional furryballs,"If my post goes against the rules, ignore it totally or take it down. Not sure about the flair either because I want to give a form of advice...? 

My mini-story is in regards to cats and this time of the year, which is coming fast, and is intended as a reminder for the people who think about adopting one of these sweethearts into their lifes:
Cats are in no way, shape or form, Christmas Presents for children to play with.

They aren't plushies or dolls or toys either.

They are fully sentient beings (like any other animal for that matter) who has feelings and emotions as well as a personality.

It happens way to often that people adopt cats as a present for their children to play with and then dispose of them like used clothes as they aren't perfect, not cuddly enough, or just get too old (not the cute kittens anymore).

As a matter of fact, one of my neighbors adopted 2 baby kittens as a Christmas present for their children, although the father had a known allergy towards cats, and made a special request for them to be from a farmland as to be able to lock them out in a garden shed for the night... In the winter... In the Alps... Not even a couple of months old kittens fresh from the tit... With temperatures going easily into the minus in Celsius for months on end, without a Heather, and snow...so much snow... 

1 of them, little baby girl tri-colour, ran away after 2 weeks of this treatment and the other one, little black baby boy with a white belly, was always sniffing more and more loudly. We saw it because since he was hours upon hours out during the day as well, shaking with cold, we opened our home to him alost everyday. 

We warned the owners that he was getting really sick and could possibly not sniff or worse, breathe anymore at some point and to go to the vet ASAP. To what they answered that they know and just gave him some arnica. 

We even called the relevant authorities and associations to ask what we should do. And we couldn't do anything but eventually kidnap him and bring him somewhere where he will be treated properly. No need to say that it will be suspicious for this baby purr to disappear after our conversation with the neighbors... 

Not even 3 months later, in the springtime, the poor baby was breathing extremely loudly and had lost the flame in his eyes and soul. Wasn't playful anymore, just inactive. Sitting there just looking at the tiles. The small, cuddly, curious and happy little kitten was a shadow of himself. And then...a couple of weeks later...you can imagine what happened. 

End of the story. And I could see this story repeat over and over and over again. As well as with the ones abandoning their animals on the highway to holiday! 

Again the reminder:
So please people, if you want to adopt a cat, then wonderful but please be aware again that your cat is going to be a full-fledged family member. They are going to stand with you in the happiest and the hardest time and give all the love they can to cheer you on. So please, treat them as such. They deserve respect and be accepted as they are.

They are not ""used stuff"" on which we have a 30 days buy back warranty. And for cats as for humans, if they are abandoned once, who says the new owner will not do the same? So time for their trust building they need. 

And spoiler: these tiny kittens are going to grow up. They evolve and will then have another type of cuteness. Not the baby face so much, but their eyes and paws and and and... 

And again cats aren't toys, cats aren't dolls, cats aren't plushies, cats aren't christmas presents to offer to your children.

They are going to be your family for 20 years. 

Finally, a point that enrages me: stop putting your cat's plates with food and water right next to the litter box and complain that they don't use said litter box. I mean dude, do you eat where you shit? 

And if you know somebody planing on this, please persuade them not to. They must find another plan for Christmas and especially, the decision has to be made by everybody in the family involved.

2023-11-09,1699545087,My Son the Menace,"Hey Friends 

I've got the cutest little kitten, around 7 months old. Some context is we adopted him from my sister a few months ago. She is 16 and adopted him from a stranger on FB Marketplace and then about 2 weeks later decided she couldn't take care of him. After a stern talk with her, we (my BF and I) took little guy in. Now, I have no experience with Cats or how to take care of them. I've been a dog person all my life. My boyfriend though, loves them. So it's been fun learning how to care for a cat. He is a good natured little guy, but an absolute menace. He loves to pounce on anything that slightly moves, always exploring and getting lost/stuck in our apartment, and playfully assassinating my dog every second he gets. He is normally too busy being rambunctious and curious to want any sort of cuddles or attention. (which is totally fine. I know he is a cat and I think it is cute, albeit a little tiring sometimes)  The most he does, is when he takes a nap, he prefers to do it as close to my face as he can regardless of what I'm doing lol. 

Lately, I have noticed that in the mornings he acts like he is absolutely STARVED for attention. At first I thought this was because of our sleeping arrangements. At night we would have the dog and cat sleep separate, have the dog in the bedroom with us, and let the cat explore the apartment at night. We mainly did this while introducing the dog and the cat to living with each other, and have since then slowly allowed the cat to have access to sleep with us during the night. Our current arrangement is he gets most of the night, but most times, my boyfriend will move him to the hallway on his 5am bathroom trip if the cat is hunting our toes. I get up for work around 630 every morning. When I open the door to see him, he runs over screaming for attention. I playfully talk with him, and go about my morning routine with the little observer. It has slowly been getting worse, lately he has just acted like it's been years since he sees me, and often tries to claw his way up to my face. If I pick him up or whatever he will headbutt me a thousand times in the face. It is so bad that if I am in the bathroom doing makeup, going to the bathroom, or brushing my teeth he will claw at me until I allow him to headbutt me. If I try to put him down too soon, he will literally hold on to me with all his claws. It has gotten to be both a time suck and very very painful as now my arms, chest and little of my neck have little scratches and puncture wounds from him. He doesn't seem to do this with my partner.

I've tried googling some research and it all is kind of inconclusive. Some articles say that he is just hungry, so I tried brining him to his food bowl when he acts like this, and he just jumps down and tries to climb up me again, sometimes I turn the sink on low so he can drink from it while I put on makeup and sometimes that works for a little bit, but he goes right back to wanting attention. Another article says he is worried about my health? I did just get diagnosed with Hypertension just recently, but  regardless of the recent diagnosis, I have had it for a while. My boyfriend says that ""he just really likes you"" and maybe that is true, but it feels like he is so desperate in the morning for it to simply be his favorite human. I also considered that he does just simply miss us during the night, but if I try to get him to come lay with us in bed, he typically refuses and leaves to go play somewhere else. 

I just want to make sure I am not missing a clear sign from this cat that he needs something. 

oh and for the record, my dog and cat seem to get along fine. The dog is around 12 and is just content sleeping, eating and getting back rubs and overall seems unphased or unbothered when the cat launches an aerial attack.",cats,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/17rfz4b/my_son_the_menace/

2023-11-07,1699317203,Littermates just spayed and neutered,"Hi all! The universal cat distribution system hit me again last week with two 6 month old strays(1 boy, 1 girl). I got them fixed today and the vet said they need to stay apart for 24-48 hours minimum while the anesthesia wears off and more if they cant stay calm so Luna(little girl) doesnt pop a stitch. I cleared out both the bathroom and the laundry room for a cute little set up per kitten. 

The problem is they cry and scratch at the door non stop unless Im in the room or theyre together. I tried rotating between rooms for snuggles, ignoring the cries hoping they would calm down, and letting them be together under supervision. Problem is Harry(little boy) is extremely interested in Lunas incision and is also more awake and wants to play. She actually started hissing at him the second time and I separated them again-cue the crying starting back up. 

My adult male cat(Voldemort) is not interested but my female adult(Hermione) has been hanging out at Lunas door very concerned with her crying in particular.  Luna does not want to be friends however and was hissing at Hermione too, so I moved my adult cats away to not stress her out more. Hermione is hanging out at Harrys door now. 

Any advice or tips? TYIA!!

so, my dear friends, i just wanted you to know that you will NOT regret adopting a pair. its truly one of the most special things ever to have two kittens and watch them grow into cats. its so much easier to take care of them too, as they entertain each other, and its so cute watching them interact and learn together. they play, groom, fight, explore&all the things, they do it together, and its so precious. would highly recommend &lt;3

2023-10-29,1698616663,"Sweet dreams, my Lottie","Currently in tears, so mind any grammar mistakes. This may be a bit of a long one...

This is Lottie, and she is my soulmate. And she died today, hit by a car. I'm still in disbelief, but have been crying since I've woken up this morning. 

2 years old, and everyone agreed she was ""my"" cat, despite legally belonging to my mother. She'd wait for me, lick me, nearly gave birth to her two kittens on me this February. 
She would ask to go ""under""neath blankets and would get all warm and cozy atop of me. (2nd pic).

 She was a quiet, and a professional seeming cat around everyone else, but around me, she truly acted like a kitten, and my bestest friend. There wasn't one day that went by where I didn't think of coming home to her and snuggling with her. She had very cute and unique habits, and is the most intelligent cat I've ever owned. 

Put my fingers on her paw, she'd grab it with her claws. Stroke her? She'll purr her head off, and eventually start licking her fingers. She had the quietest meow, and only purred loud if I was there with her. When her kittens became more playful, she'd show them to hunt, and would bring them toys. She once brought a fake fish ornament into the garden which she had stolen, and would waddle them over a stick toy with a mouse on the end. She would bring them the occasional leaf too. 

She loved being cuddled while under the covers, or in cozy confined spaces, she felt so safe around me. I would leave to my dads on weekends, and she'd eagerly wait for me to return on Sundays. 

Early hours this morning, she was hit by a car, and most likely died instantly. Likewise, I knew instantly, that she was involved in an accident because it was unusual for her not to come to me on mornings. Truth was, she was dead at that point. 

But certain police van was nearbye, and retrieved her body, before going to the nearest vet. In my country, this is not standard practice, the police went out of their way to do this, and meant, though she had already passed, I could see her and stroke her one last time. I told her all my plans I would've done with her, told her about how much I loved her, and that I'll take care of her kittens for her, and hopefully be reunited in the afterlife, where we could finally redeem those stolen moments we shouldve had together. 

I disagree with the notion that ""everyone has their time."" Lottie was killed, and her time was stolen from her. If the universe wanted to send a message any more clear than having policemen take her body to a kind vet, and just so happen to be around, and then just so happen to care when it's discouraged from their role (as the police admin woman told me), then this was it. It wasn't her time, and literal justice was there to make sure her body wasn't injured further. 

The only silver lining however, I realized, is a great big chain of causation, that I started. My local area was a Red Light District before I moved in, and I was at the forefront of the protests to end the crimes, for the safety of the community. This was back in 2016, up to 2020. And the protest won, after my story was heard by a local councillor. This increased police patrols in the area. Fast forward to today, it was one of those policemen, who most likely wouldn't have been there had it not been for my protests, to give her to a vet. 


It hurts so much. And I have lost other kittens before too, but everyone, even non-family members considered me and her to be soulmates. And I don't disagree. I'll be getting a tattoo of her paw print, so she'll always be with me in a way, for all those stolen moments. And the worst part is, if there is an afterlife, I doubt she'd be happy up there without me, just emphasizing her love and dependence she gave to me. And I won't be happy here without her either, but I have to look after her kittens, they'll miss her alot,, keep her memory, hopefully be reunited eventually in whatever way. Me and my bestest friend

That last pic was the last pic I ever took of her (yesterday) after I spoilt her with love. This whole post will never recapture Lottie, or preserve her little quirks or personality, but Id like to think, those actions in the past, meant that that policeman was in the area, and eventhough I wasn't there, it was only fitting that my actions would give her a peaceful goodbye after her death. 

Sweet dreams Lottie-naughtie. I love you so much. Hope we meet again, and that even in a spirit form, you never leave my side.

2023-10-27,1698372516,Introducing a new kitten??,"Hello,

My wife and I recently took another kitten home from a farm. She's 6 months old and female, and very cute. Our 3yro male cat was pretty upset when we brought her home. At first we kept them separated, not allowing them to interact at all. Then after a week we let them see each other a bit and the kitten was excited as hell to meet Alfred, but he was not into her at all, and was growling at her and hissing. Then after another week of gradual interaction, Alfred (male 3yro) wants to play with her, but shes now terrified of him, who is trying to play tag/chase, hide and seek stuff. 

Does anyone have experience with introducing a new kitten and have some tips to share? I've looked through several reliable sources on cat behavior and I'm wondering if there are things you all have tried that worked outside of: slow introduction, introducing scent to each other, keeping them separated, separate litter, food and water, separate beds, separate toys, etc...

One thing that breaks our heart is that Alfred always used to sleep in our bed with us at our feet, and now he won't come near us at night. Can we get him back???

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, getting a second cat has proven more difficult than we wanted, but we really hope they will come to play with each other and at least tolerate each other. ",cats,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/17hczo3/introducing_a_new_kitten/

2023-10-25,1698259293,New kitten is not a confident jumper,"This community has been so helpful for me! Now I have a question that might come off as overthinking, but oh well.

I adopted two brother kittens. I suspect they have different dads but same mom/same litter. 

The smallest one (brown tabby) is a great jumper! They're 15 weeks old and he's already jumping on the counters (which isn't my favorite thing but I do find it cool that he can already jump so high!)

The other one (orange tabby) is not a confident jumper at all and is quite clumsy in general. He can't jump on the counter and I've noticed when he jumps to his cat tree, he hesitates and it's kinda pitiful (in a cute way) when he does jump. And he's the same when he's jumping down, too. Which is strange considering he's bigger than the other one. 

When we are playing, he will jump for the toy but he just can't really jump very high at all lol. He will do the tiniest jump ever to get a toy way high in the air. Almost like he can't really tell how high he needs to jump lol. 

Meanwhile the other one is an honorary kangaroo (we even named him Roo). 

As far as I can tell (and I've already had their kitten vet visits and everything was normal), he's perfectly healthy and happy. He's just not a confident jumper. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Should I be worried? 
2. Should I take him back to the vet and ask?
3. Assuming nothing is wrong, is there anything I can do to help him be more confident at jumping?

2023-10-25,1698253588,I can't stop thinking about getting a cat...,"Long story short, I grew up with two cats but moved out last year (three hours away from them &lt;/3) and I can't stop thinking about getting my own cat. I always knew I wanted one but my mom is very opposed to it because she hates how locked down she feels. I don't care, I think I was meant to own cats in my life. I don't want children, never wanted them, always wanted cats.

Browsed a local marketplace kind of thing for cats and found the most adorable kitten. Like, usually I can see a cat and be ""oh they're so cute! but nah... not for me!"" but this one? I totally fell in love? Then I found out the current owner has people over tonight to meet the kitten. BUT THE GOOD THING IS! He has a sister! And she's equally as adorable!

For the past 5 hours I haven't been able to stop thinking about finally getting a cat. Like, I can't relax. These two kittens I found completely won me over and I think, if I get the opportunity, I'm gonna go visit them.

2023-10-24,1698162599,Dont be Afraid of Drugs,"This is some advice for people with difficult, jumpy, kind of rude cats: try drugs. Disclaimer that this obviously isnt the solution for all or possibly even most cats with behavioral issues. 

My bf has a cat, Anakin, that we had to integrate into our household when we moved in together, and it has been an incredibly difficult transition for Anakin. We knew it would be hard because Anakin was already a stressed, anxious cat that would hiss at me for just existing. My bf is the only person he would act cute with and he would walk through the house keeping low and wary even in spaces he should feel comfortable.

I had two cats already who arent territorial and are pretty friendly to other cats, but Anakin wasnt having it. We followed all directions, keeping everyone separated, feeding through the door, pheromone sprays, play time, screen doors, treats, bed swaps, etc. Nothing mattered because no matter what, Anakin never felt safe or relaxed unless he was asleep. It wasnt outright aggression so much as panic constantly on the verge of defensive aggression. It didnt help that we stumbled across 3 baby kittens and their dead mother around our new home and were unable to find a shelter to take themwe spent the next month and a half finding homes for them and ending up keeping one. Ironically, Anakin was way more calm around the new kitten than my older cats.

Needless to say after 4 months of little to no improvement, we spoke with our vet, got a blood test, and they prescribed Anakin with Prozac. 

He is a new cat. He no longer exits his room hissing, he is staying level emotionally, and he is playing with and bathing the new kitten frequently. He honestly likes her a lot. I am astounded at how much happier he is. My cats still dont like him because he was rude (hissy/swatty) with them before, but they dont view him as a threat. He still acts like Anakin, still doesnt like me, but he no longer reacts like he expects the world to hurt him.

Im sharing this because basically everything I found online shared that basics and didnt address an already chronically anxious cat. On some Reddit posts, people were arguing its not right to drug a cat to make them happier/behaveI think thats a warped and damaging view that very much reminds me of why it took so long for ME to get medicated for MY anxiety. Animals can be just as unbalanced as humans and you dont get a gold star for suffering in life. It might not be right for everyone, but its been right for Anakin to have a little medical intervention for him to be happier. If youre in a similar situation its definitely worth talking to your vet.",cats,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/17ffzbj/dont_be_afraid_of_drugs/
2023-10-23,1698084114,Honest opinions,"Hi!  Meet my foster kitten, Zazu.  Zazu is the sweetest, chattiest little boy.  He loves to cuddle and he can do pretty much anything a sighted cat can do.  

Zazu came into the rescue with ocular herpes.  His third (inner) eyelids are fused to his eyes. I am fortunate to live a town away from a major veterinary hospital/school.  I picked Zazu up from his original foster at the end of August and he went in for surgery to loosen the lids in late September.  While there, the doctors confirmed he foes have some sight--he can see light and dark, but that's about it.  The eye on his right (our left if we're facing him) has glaucoma and is distorted by the pressure.  It may be painful but doesn't seem to bother him.  

The rescue has a difficult decision to make this week and I was asked to weigh in.  Here are the options:

1) remove the eye.  This leaves him a pirate kitty with one eye, an eye which is damaged but not painful or suffering glaucoma.
2) loosen the eyelid, with the knowledge he may need the eye removed later.  This may make him less adoptable.
3) do nothing, which means daily drops to relieve the pressure and he may still need the the removed later.  While he would keep the most sight this way, it means finding an adopter who is willing to fight moring and evening to get eye drops in and/or would be willing to remove the eye later.

Which brings me to why I'm here.  If it were me, I'd choose option three.  He'd keep the most sight that way.  But I also want him to have the happiest, best life which means finding a forever home.  And the harsh reality is the longer we try to treat the eyes, the older and less kitten-cute (and adoptable) he gets. 

So here are my questions:

1) do his eyes creep you out?  
2) would you be willing to adopt a one eyed cat?
3) what about no eyes?
4) what about wonky eyes like this?
5) what about a cat who might need expensive surgery?
6) or daily drops?",cats,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/17eqqgh/honest_opinions/
2023-10-23,1698044313,MIL says kittens have fleas and don't want them.,"My MIL has kittens on her garden. It is a very big garden and she also has chikens there. She had a cat which had 4 kittens which are in the garden now, but other stray kittens also eat from the same food. She says she doesn't want to feed the stray kittens 9 because they have fleas, and she feeds the other very little food because she doesn't want that it remains food for the other kittens. 

The poor kittens are continuously hungry and it breaks my heart. I feed them each morning because I work with my MIL and she got very angry the last day because I put them more food. 

What could be a solution for the stray kitten's fleas? I can't catch them, they run away when they see a person. But they are so cute I don't want them to be hungry. The mother of the kittens died hit by a car because my MIL wouldn't feed her enough and she went to look for food away from home until she got near the street and died 9 I don't want the same for this kittens, I see a lot of dead cats in the street here. 

What can I do? Is it there some product I can spread on the floor to kill the fleas?

2023-10-17,1697517933,Is there a reason my cat is so vocal?,"Hi! I have two kitties both around 7 months. One of them is super vocal. He yowls and cries all the time. Its not boredom- hes played with constantly, has plenty of toys when not explicitly played with, and is constantly playing with our other kitten. He also shows no other signs of boredom. Well taken care of as far as necessities as well. 

It mainly happens whenever one of us closes a door (usually the bathroom, we almost never close them out of a room were in) but also happen at other random times.  Its also not just yowling- he makes little sound effects when he moves. A tiny yelp (bad choice of word but cant describe it any way else but its not in pain, just like a short sound but not a meow) every time he jumps. It reminds me of when a character jumps in a video game and makes a small sound, its kinda cute except for when he jumps at night when im trying to sleep lol. 

Kitty shows no signs of unhappiness. Shows all signs of affection to us, loves to cuddle and be held. Makes biscuits, nuzzles on us, all the signs of comfort. Purrs allll the time and his purring is also super loud too if that means anything. Also 100% positive that the yowling is never to ask for food or water or to change the litter btw- very on top of that. 

 Im just wondering if theres any possible reason for this or if its just part of his personality. The yowling can get a bit annoying honestly- I have to distract him with a laser pointer whenever my bf goes to the bathroom lol. Other than that no concerns with his health or happiness, just curious about causation. Other kitty only meows for specific reasons so definitely adds to my curiosity on this one.

the problem is my resident cat. shes around 10-11 years old, and also a stray cat. i found her when she was about two months old. 
at first, before i took in the new cat, they were interacting through the door. my resident cat tried to attack her through the door. when i moved the new cat inside and into her room, she quickly accepted the room as the new cats territory and wouldnt go inside. 

its been hard doing the room swapping method with the kittens. but the kittens are about to go to their new homes, and ill be able to focus on them. 
but as of now, when i do supervised face to face interaction my resident cat has been so nasty to the new cat that shes horrified of her. 

when she wants to come out of her area, they normally avoid each other, but when my resident cat comes near the new cat will walk away and tuck her tail away and look really afraid. shes chased her, tried to  swipe at her. 
and i know straight up exposure is not the way. ive never done this in my life and i need some help. i want them to at least accept each other. do i need to restart this process? will it even work if i try again? or do i just have to wait.
